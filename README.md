# Augmented-Reality-using-OpenCV
In this application of OpenCV, we am going to overlay a video on top of a static image inturn creating a visual illusion. This is done in real time using the computer's Webcam.
We can move around our static image infront of our webcam but what we will see on the screen is the same image overlayed with another random video.

### Concepts Used
1. Feature Detection (using ORB feature detector)
2. Homography
3. Warping
4. Image Masking
